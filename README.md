> CircleCI orb for connecting to a WireGuard VPN

It allows you to establish a WireGuard VPN connection from within a CircleCI build job.


## Prerequisites

The following environment variables need to be set in CircleCI either directly or via a context:

- WIREGUARD_CONFIG

Variable has to contain a Base64 encoded WireGuard VPN config file

```shell
$ cat <<EOF | base64
> [Interface]
> PrivateKey = <private-key>=
> Address = 192.0.0.1/32
> DNS = 10.0.0.13
>
> [Peer]
> PublicKey = <public-key>=
> AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
> Endpoint = 50.210.50.3:51820
> EOF
```

If `AllowedIPs` is "0.0.0.0/0" the CircleCI container will stop responding and the build will crush. To avoid this "0.0.0.0/0" will be replaced with the public IP of the current job while execution.

See [CircleCI Documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars) for instructions on how you would set this up.
